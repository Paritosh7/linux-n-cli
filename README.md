- Linux is a distribution that is based on UNIX philosophy. (same as macOS) Further, Ubuntu is a distribution (also known as distros) derived from Debian. Remember that there can be multiple distros and each distro has its know capability and Ubuntu is one of them.

- Kernel is the core part of any distribution and any new distro is made on top of the old distribution kernel with further capabilities that it want to concentrate on.

- Bash is a tool i.e. an interactive shell which lets you interact with the OS's kernel.

- pwd (present working directory)
- pwd --help (--help will tell what a particular will do)
- cd / (/ is the root directory and here you are changing the directory to the root directory)
- cd ../.. (this will go one directory up and then another directory, used in relative paths)
- Using just . means "this" directory, so cd . means change directory to this directory, also an example of relative path.
